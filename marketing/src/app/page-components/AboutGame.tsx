            <h2>Game Summary</h2>

            <p>
                In the distant future, humans are born with magical abilities. The city of New Gem heroes called "Knights" protect people from those who wish to abuse 
                their powers. These people are known as "Outlaws."
                In New Gem City, a young man named Adam hopes to one day be a Knight. Unfortunately, he was born powerless. Not deterred by fate Adam 
                creates a magical suit of armor to protect the city from the local gang called Dark Wings. Along the way, he will make new friends and learn what 
                being a hero means.
